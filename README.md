# 🎤 Voice Emotion Recognition (Forked & Extended)

A Python-based web application that detects human emotions from voice audio using **TensorFlow** and **Flask**.  
Users can upload a `.wav` audio file, listen to it, and receive real-time emotion predictions.

> 🔖 This project is **forked from the original work by Hamama Komal**.  
> I am maintaining and extending this repository for **learning, experimentation, and future enhancements** in AI & Machine Learning.
